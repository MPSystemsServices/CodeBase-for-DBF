Compilation projects have been set up for all 4 versions of the CodeBase DLL client:
Stand-Alone User version - 32-bit
Stand-Alone User version - 64-bit
Client Server Client version - 32-bit
Client Server Client version - 64-bit

These projects were created for Microsoft Visual Studio 2022

You should plan on using the MSVS 2022 projects to build new versions of these 4 DLL modules.

These files are provided as a possible convenience for users wanting a command-line way to
launch compilation.  The maintainer of this repository makes no representations as to their
correctness.
