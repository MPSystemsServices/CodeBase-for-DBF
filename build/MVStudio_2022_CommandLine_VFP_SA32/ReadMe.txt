Compilation launchers have been set up in this directory for all 4 versions of the CodeBase DLL client:
Stand-Alone User version - 32-bit
Stand-Alone User version - 64-bit
Client Server Client version - 32-bit
Client Server Client version - 64-bit

These projects were created for Microsoft Visual Studio 2022

These files are provided as a possible convenience for users wanting a command-line way to
launch compilation.  The maintainer of this repository makes no representations as to their
correctness. 

We recommend that instead of these .cmd files you instead follow the instructions in the file
SourceCodeReadMe_Sept_2023.md found in the WorkingSource directory.
