Beware the name of this directory 'source' in that it is really just the place where Visual Studio
parks the intermediate object files from its compilation of the many individual *.c files that
are part of the CodeBase source code project.  You may safely ignore the contents of this directory
unless you have specific interest in the object files or the log files that go with them.
