      This demonstration program helps give you an idea of the kind
      of speed you can expect when using CodeBase 6 in your database
      applications. The demo lets you to test the ability of CodeBase
      to create data and index files, and to perform complex queries
      on the resulting database.

      The files included with this demo are

      README.TXT        - This File
      CB6DEMO.EXE       - The demo program itself
      CB6DEMO.DLL       - A special demo version of the CodeBase DLL.
      MSVBVM50.DLL      - Visual Basic 5.0 run-time DLL, required to
                          run this application.
      

      To run the demo program, simply type CodeBase Demo.exe from the 
      command line prompt, or using any of the Windows 98/95/NT file 
      browsing tools (such as Windows Explorer) locate CB6DEMO.EXE
      and double-click it's icon to launch the application.

      The demo program allows you to create a test database that you
      can then query for information. As a result some hard disk space is 
      required to run the application. The application provides this 
      information to you before you create the database.

      This application was written in Visual Basic 5.0 and requires
      Windows 95, 98 or NT to run. CodeBase also supports programming in
      C++, C and Delphi.

      CodeBase for Windows/DOS platforms sells for $395 US. Other versions
      of CodeBase are available for Unix, Macintosh and OS/2.
