                     CodeBase Speed Demo Program                                                                  


      This demonstration program helps give you an idea of the kind
      of speed you can expect when using CodeBase 6 in your database
      applications. The demo lets you to test the ability of CodeBase
      to create data and index files, and to perform complex queries
      on the resulting database.

      The files included with this demo are

      README.TXT     - This File
      ACME.EXE       - The demo program itself
      C4ACME.DLL     - A special demo version of the CodeBase DLL.
      MSVBVM50.DLL   - Visual Basic 5.0 run-time DLL, required to
                       run this application (This file may not be
                       present if you downloaded the demo version
                       that doesn't contain VB support files).
      

      To run the demo program, simply type ACME.EXE from the command
      line prompt, or using any of the Windows 95/NT file browsing
      tools (such as Windows Explorer) locate ACME.EXE and double-click 
      it's icon to launch the application.

      The demo program allows you to create a test database that you
      can then query for information. As a result some hard disk space is 
      required to run the application. The application provides this 
      information to you before you create the database.

      This application was written in Visual Basic 5.0 and requires
      Windows 95 or NT to run. CodeBase also supports programming in
      C++, C, Delphi and Java.
