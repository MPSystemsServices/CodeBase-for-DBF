Explanation of files in codeBaseserver2020 directory

Sequiter Software has provided all of their development files for the Codebase product except for the ODBC driver source and its SQL interpreter, which were purchased products.

The first files they delivered are in srvsrc.zip, which they thought was the latest files for the server product.  They proved to be older than files already in our source directory from when we acquired the source license.

On March 10, 2020, Cameron Stobbe, the former CodeBase developer, supplied us with development.zip, which he said was the latest full production compile directory from which their commercial versions of the product were produced.  This appears to include not only Windows 32-bit tools, but also Windows 64-bit tools as well as linux versions for the stand alone client, the server client, and the server itself.  There is also code for the CB Admin console for management of the server.
